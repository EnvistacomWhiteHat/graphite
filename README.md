# Graphite

### ✍️ A local-first Markdown note-taking app built with Vue.js and Electron.

- In 2020, I quit my tech job to focus on creating web development tutorials on [YouTube](youtube.com/SuboptimalEng).
- After spending a few months playing around with different technologies, I decided to focus on Vue + Tailwind.
- In order to test how far I've come with the tech stack, I made Graphite, a local-first markdown note-taking app.
- Note: I built Graphite in ~1 week so don't mind the code quality or lack of tests.
